"The Rust parser for simple yet expressive pixel fonts!"

# Synoposis

spf.rs is a parser library built in Rust for the [SimplePixelFont file specifications](https://github.com/SimplePixelFont/Specification). It is both a native crate (spf) and also an FFI library (libspf). As a result you can use the parser in a variety of programming languages which support library loading and the platform specific C ABI. This includes the following languages and more; C/C++, Julia, Python, JS, WASM (no official builds hosted yet). spf.rs is also the official and maintained parser for the SPF specifications and the project will always attempt to parallel developments within the specifications.
